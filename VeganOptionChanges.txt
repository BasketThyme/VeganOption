Vegan Option
1. DONE: Doll Eye can now be used to make Mundane potion and poison, such as spider eye
2. DONE:changed basin to accept 5 bucket (blocks/tiles/TileEntityBasin -- line 33: *5) - change use bucket/bottle to fill and remove (see 5)
3. !doll eye grass unchecked
4. DONE:ClassTransforer never finds "net.minecraft.block.blockpistonbase" - SEE#10
5. DONE:make bucket/bottle usable on basin - filling seems to work by repeatedly dumping/creative (see #2)
6. Raw Ender bucket has no JEI recipe -> added RelationshipRegistry.addRelationship(ItemStack(encrustedObsidian), bucketRawEnder.copy()); in Ender.java
7. ~~Milk bucket - use cactus, but make it poison player
8. DONE: (see #20)jei for tuft - shows unknown texture as input
9. DONE: jute plant does not show up in creative tab - added line77: .setCreativeTab(VeganOption.creativeTab)
10. DONE:piston crafting in-world needs rework (handler,recipe, registry) and is not required to make milk or lye -SEE#4
11. DONE: bucket recipes are doubling leftover ingrediants (Milk/Lye) - cause: bucket is removed before (CraftingModifier) recipe search(net.minecraft.inventory.CraftingManager)->unable to find recipe - fix: CraftingModifier (line 83->86) replace water bucket without a container
12. DONE: bucket items (milk/raw/lye) are not in the creative tab
13. ~~~ add retted jute bundle to creative tab and jei - juteBundled.rettedItem.setCreativeTab(VeganOption.creativeTab); in jute.java line: 73
14. ~~~ add flow input block to bottom of basin to fill or drain / grate
15. DONE:what are passive compost benefits on adjacent farmland? growables need to be directly horizontally adjacent or above (compost->farm block->plant)
16. !!!ItemStack - check all references for @nonnull
17. DONE:add more borwn for composter:stick, wood? if included already, unablee to add stick
18. DONE: check vegtableoil.java again - ink recipes using 2x vegoil bottle per - cause by Modifiers.crafting.addInputsToRemoveForOutput (line:115 & 120) - these are only necessary when waterBottle (vegoil) = 1
19. DONE: BlockHelper can no longer use Reflection.invoke as it results in crash at blockStateToItemStack method. Replaceed with getSilkTouchDrop method from Block
20. DONE(see #8): In order to get the correct meta in Kapok.java for Jungle leaves, properties: .withProperty(BlockOldLeaf.CHECK_DECAY, Boolean.valueOf(false)).withProperty(BlockOldLeaf.DECAYABLE, Boolean.valueOf(true)) need to be set, mainly CHECK_DECAY=false
21. ~~Create advanced multi block to include mashing(piston), pressurizing(pressure plate), mixing(dough)
22. ~~add tofu as option
23. DONE:Basin: change basin to have fluid stability check, certain fluids should not flow out - bucket/bottle not usable on basin, fill or empty --- DONE: see#27 1 block below rift - directly under(0 blocks below) does nothing -does not create full rawender block
24. DONE: Make frozenbubble and ItemWashableWheat directly usable on basin
25. Done: raw ender should be a full block - is full when contained
26. DONE: glassbottle pickup veg oil, inks, soap solution, lye, rawender, milk = water bottle - PlayerControllerMP.class call net.minecraftforge.common.ForgeHooks.onItemRightClickAction(player, stack); results in NULL instead of PASS/DENY - the problem is a player interact with block(fluid) checks the variant item(fluid), and results in a water bottle - resolved by creating a new event FluidContainerHelper.playerRightClickItem
27. DONE: see#23 - changed raw ender to spawn at block below rift-> then to flow to the lowest solid block, both cause block update->disovle fluid if not full bucket - see BlockRawEnder and BlockEnderRift
28. DONE: Uneccesary - need to provide provention if non desired effects- make basin usable with pipes from other mods -seems to work with pressure pipes
29. DONE:see#23-basin - powering block changes direction of top/intake - 
30. DONE: BlockBasin#addCollisionBoxToList, what is the point of this method? called everytime player is within a certain distance, and adds a direct block collision to the method variable collingBoundingBox, which only resets after method
31. !RenderBasin#renderTileEntity is called continously, is it necessary?
32. DONE:see#29-placing basin next to power source doesnt update is_powered(open), only when adding powersource or doing blockupdate around it- onBlockAdded was not changing the actual blockstate
33. DONE:BlockBasin has a constant update to isSideSolid (to check powered), possibly change to check during blockupdate 
34. DONE:Basin cause rawender to not dissolve until block update? recheck once basin conversion complete
35. DONE: create basin fluidRegisterStability with stability enum (default value Tolerant), adds property stability to fluids, 
	basin consumes fluid based on the variable and dissolves remaining, - may need to replace the block with blockfinite when stability is low
	righthandclick - can only withdraw if fluid can create full container
36. ~Basin - inserting items (frozen bubble/..) returns the resulting of applying it to the fluid, or is rejected - will provide automation ability - check RelationShipRegistry->Recipe against item and fluid for ouput
37. DONE: recipe for encrustedObsidian has been changed to produce 1 block, should be more expensive to make
38. DONE:Basin has fluid && isopen && not facing up && facing direction block is air, fluid should seep out at a stability rate
39. DONE:Basin direction changeable
40. DONE: BlockRawEnder - particle/sound while dissolve
41. DONE: Basin now uses metadata to store properties for reload
42. ~~BlockRawEner to flow vertically up instead of down?
43. DONE: Rendering for TileEntityBasin#update for BlockLiquid and BlockFluidFinite Models for leaking
44. DONE:apple sauce should require a piston for mashing?
45. !!!JEI - using depricated methods - update - 
46. DONE:Composter - add green - wheat - added many vegatables
47. !!!Creativetab/jei - Bucket Rawender has no recipe - Bedstraw has different notation - jutefibre displays unretted jutebundle - blank mob head > add recipe for variations? 
48. DONE: Recipes - soap solution > consumes bucket - papier mache > consumes bucket - blaze rod > increase flint and steel usage - wheat > wheat dough > raw seitan > consumes bucket > false morel not listed as fermented spider eye replacement
49. ~!~Additions: Prismarine Shard/Prismarine Crystals alternative? sea Guardian drop/ lantern silk touch - Shulker Shell > shulkers - Rabbit foot alt - dragon egg (raise a bunny/cat) - nether star 
50. DONE:test caomparator on Basin
51. prismarine shard/crystal - shulker shell = found at the deepest levels of an ocean? mining shells? growing crystals and shells?
52. DONE:Jute - bottom breaks in farm - only a seed - check for full growth and provide bounty from breaking top or bottom, or make more like sugarcane! break top, rest grows -- 
53. DONE:composting- additions do not appear to work for compost
54. ~~~integrate with forestry - seeds, compost (Fermentor)
55. ~~~IC2 - "crop" integration
56.  ~~~do something with dirt and cobblestone
57. DONE:Filling frozen bubble with water creates Ender pearl
58. DONE:Frozen Bubble bounding box collision - going through blocks 
59. DONE:Soap bottle full use destroy bottle
60. DONE: change enderrift to only destroy water blocks during the day
61. !!!add dirt to compost in limited supply
62. DONE:jute plant randomly disappearing


Upcoming Changes/Fixes

Frozen Bubble - Collision Issues, ie.. passes through blocks - Filling with water creates ender pearl, huh? nope.
Soap Solution - destroys bottle on use, doesn't make sense to me
Ender Rift - destroys blocks around it. As a builder, I find this annoying since I put time into design. Currently, rift+basin already produces a loss, so the change will be to only destroy water blocks during the day.
Jute stalks - breaking bottom produces only one seed at full growth, this doesn't make sense.
Composting - adding dirt in limited supply. Makes sense, and dirt needs more uses.








Updates:
JutePlant resolved
Soap bottle
Frozen Bubble
EnderRift
