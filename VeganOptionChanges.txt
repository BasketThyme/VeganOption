Vegan Option
1. DONE: Doll Eye can now be used to make Mundane potion and poison, such as spider eye
2. DONE:changed basin to accept 5 bucket (blocks/tiles/TileEntityBasin -- line 33: *5) - change use bucket/bottle to fill and remove (see 5)
3. doll eye grass unchecked
4. !!!ClassTransforer never finds "net.minecraft.block.blockpistonbase"
5. !!!make bucket/bottle usable on basin - filling seems to work by repeatedly dumping/creative (see #2)
6. Raw Ender bucket has no JEI recipe -> added RelationshipRegistry.addRelationship(ItemStack(encrustedObsidian), bucketRawEnder.copy()); in Ender.java
7. ~~Milk bucket - use cactus, but make it poison player
8. DONE: (see #20)jei for tuft - shows unknown texture as input
9. DONE: jute plant does not show up in creative tab - added line77: .setCreativeTab(VeganOption.creativeTab)
10. !!!piston crafting in-world needs rework (handler,recipe, registry) and is not required to make milk or lye
11. DONE: bucket recipes are doubling leftover ingrediants (Milk/Lye) - cause: bucket is removed before (CraftingModifier) recipe search(net.minecraft.inventory.CraftingManager)->unable to find recipe - fix: CraftingModifier (line 83->86) replace water bucket without a container
12. DONE: bucket items (milk/raw/lye) are not in the creative tab
13. ~~~ add retted jute bundle to creative tab and jei - juteBundled.rettedItem.setCreativeTab(VeganOption.creativeTab); in jute.java line: 73
14. ~~compost as farmland alternative?
15. ~~what are passive compost benefits on adjacent farmland?
16. !!!ItemStack - check all references for @nonnull
17. ~~add more borwn for composter:stick, wood?
18. !!! check vegtableoil.java again - ink recipes using 2x vegoil bottle per - cause by Modifiers.crafting.addInputsToRemoveForOutput (line:115 & 120) - these are only necessary when waterBottle (vegoil) = 1
19. DONE: BlockHelper can no longer use Reflection.invoke as it results in crash at blockStateToItemStack method. Replaceed with getSilkTouchDrop method from Block
20. DONE(see #8): In order to get the correct meta in Kapok.java for Jungle leaves, properties: .withProperty(BlockOldLeaf.CHECK_DECAY, Boolean.valueOf(false)).withProperty(BlockOldLeaf.DECAYABLE, Boolean.valueOf(true)) need to be set, mainly CHECK_DECAY=false
21. ~~Create advanced multi block to include mashing(piston), pressurizing(pressure plate), mixing(dough)
22. ~~add tofu as option
23. !!!Basin: change basin to have fluid stability check, certain fluids should not flow out - bucket/bottle not usable on basin, fill or empty --- DONE: see#27 1 block below rift - directly under(0 blocks below) does nothing -does not create full rawender block
24. ~~~Make frozenbubble directly usable on basin?
25. Done: raw ender should be a full block - is full when contained
26. DONE: glassbottle pickup veg oil, inks, soap solution, lye, rawender, milk = water bottle - PlayerControllerMP.class call net.minecraftforge.common.ForgeHooks.onItemRightClickAction(player, stack); results in NULL instead of PASS/DENY - the problem is a player interact with block(fluid) checks the variant item(fluid), and results in a water bottle - resolved by creating a new event FluidContainerHelper.playerRightClickItem
27. DONE: see#23 - changed raw ender to spawn at block below rift-> then to flow to the lowest solid block, both cause block update->disovle fluid if not full bucket - see BlockRawEnder and BlockEnderRift
28. ~~~make basin usable with pipes from other mods
29. ~~~see#23-basin - powering block changes direction of top/intake - 
30. !BlockBasin#addCollisionBoxToList, what is the point of this method? called everytime player is within a certain distance, and adds a direct block collision to the method variable collingBoundingBox, which only resets after method
31. !RenderBasin#renderTileEntity is called continously, is it necessary?
32. DONE:see#29-placing basin next to power source doesnt update is_powered(open), only when adding powersource or doing blockupdate around it- onBlockAdded was not changing the actual blockstate
33. !BlockBasin has a constant update to isSideSolid (to check powered), possibly change to check during blockupdate 
34. !!!Basin cause rawender to not dissolve? recheck once basin conversion complete
